<h4>Bloomfield Germania</h4>
<p>The <em>Bloomfield Germania</em> was published in Knox County, Nebraska, from 1896-1914. During its heyday, it maintained close connections with newspapers in other German American communities and 
in Europe. For a while, subscriptions to the <em>Bloomfield Germania</em> were only available with a subscription to <em>Die Acker und Gartenbau Zeitung</em>  or “the Agricultural and Horticultural Newspaper” 
of Milwaukee. Domestic subscriptions were $1.50 per year, with higher rates for mailings to Europe. As with many small town newspapers in Nebraska, there were several editors and publishers—among 
them Henry Lohmann, Friederich Wiedemann, John Reins and Theodore Jensen.</p>  
<p>The issues often sported national news gleaned from other German language newspapers while bulletins of “international” news were only news of German-speaking Europe arranged by German state. 
These bulletins were titled “Postnachrichten aus der alten Heimath” or “postal news from the old homeland.” Additionally, there was serialized fiction, ranging from trivial romances to more 
significant works by notable German authors such as Paul Scheerbart. One of the more interesting pieces of content was a column written in Anglo-German vernacular by “Lizzie Hanfstengel” offering 
“anecdotes of a German-American housewife” and which was possibly syndicated.</p>
<p>Local content included market reports with prices of different crops, as well as ads almost exclusively for local businesses and printed in German. Examples of articles include a report about a 
funeral written from the perspective of the family whose grandfather had passed away, details about a barn burning down and occasionally longer reports about Knox County and Nebraskan news, plus 
notices of meetings—for instance there was a brief note about a meeting of the “Deutscher Staatsverband Nebraska” or “German Federation of Nebraska” in Lincoln. WWI led to such anti-German feeling that such organizations quickly folded.</p> 
<p>In 1914, the <em>Bloomfield Germania</em> was absorbed into the <em>Wöchentliche Omaha Tribüne</em> [LCCN: sn95070034].</p>
