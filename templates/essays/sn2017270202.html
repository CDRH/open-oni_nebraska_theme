<h4>Cedar County Wachter</h4>
<p><em>The Hartington Herald</em> [LCCN: sn94056624] of July 8, 1898, reported, “Charles Weiss, of Omaha, is in the city looking up the prospects for a new German newspaper which he contemplates establishing here.” Just a few short weeks later, the <em>Cedar County Wächter</em> was born, publishing its first issue on August 28, 1898. Selling for $1.50 per year, the <em>Wächter</em> also offered a $2.00 package deal with the <em>New Yorker Staats-Zeitung</em> [LCCN: sn83030124] and an agricultural newspaper, <em>Acker und Gartenbau Zeitung</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Wächter</em>, “The only German newspaper for Germans of Cedar County” was considered the most important German title in Northeastern Nebraska. Publishing every Thursday, the <em>Wächter</em> ran six columns on each of its eight pages. It boasted the mottos “To the right: Against the wrong” and “Truth above all else”. News sections covered various regions of Germany, including Oldenburg, Westphalia, and Brandenburg.</p>
<p>For the <em>Wächter</em>’s entire 20-year run, Weiss remained the sole owner, publisher, and editor. After emigrating from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Weiss settled in Omaha where he learned the newspaper business working at German language titles. In Hartington, he served as an election official, on the Cedar County Defense Council, and as a member of the Sons of Hermann (a German-American mutual aid and insurance society) and the Knights of Columbus. </p>
<p>Over the years, Weiss and the <em>Wächter</em> were involved in many controversies. In 1903, the <em>Wächter</em> and the <em>Cedar County News</em> [LCCN: sn95073153] had a dispute over the printing of legal notices, with the <em>Wächter</em> arguing, “The official announcements of the county should also be printed in the Wächter in the German language that the Germans, who are the heaviest taxpayers will also know what becomes of the money.” The disagreement continued into 1904 with the <em>News</em> saying, “It matters little to us what Mr. Weiss thinks of our business principles. We endeavor to mind our own business and would invite him to do the same.” </p>
<p>In 1910, Weiss was arrested and held in contempt for a letter threatening Judge Guy Graves of Nebraska’s Eighth District Court over a trial concerning a Hartington man accused of sexual assault. According to the <em>Omaha Daily Bee</em> [LCCN: sn99021999], “The letter accuses the judge of discriminating against the defendant . . . because he is a Catholic.” Weiss was sentenced to 10 days in county jail (later suspended) and $13 in court costs.</p>
<p>With U.S. entry into World War I, Weiss sparred with <em>Omaha Nebraskan</em> [LCCN: sn93059248] editor Richard Metcalfe who accused the <em>Wächter</em> of preaching “Kaiserism” rather than Americanism and ran anti-<em>Wächter</em> advertisements. A January 1917 editorial said, “These German editors need to be told that this is America, not Germany. So far as the Nebraskan is concerned, I tell it to them now.” The <em>Wächter</em> ceased publication August 22, 1917, with the <em>Cedar County News</em> reporting, “In deference to the growing antagonism to the use of the German language he (Weiss) has decided to suspend publication of his paper believing that it has done what it could for the Americanization of the German speaking people of this section.”</p>
