<h4>Wageworker</h4>

<p>Over the course of his sixty-year newspaper career, Will M. Maupin (1863-1948) contributed stories, opinions, and humor to papers like the eastern Nebraska newspaper, <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86063422/"><i>Falls City Journal</i></a>, to the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95069158/"><i>Gering Midwest</i></a>, published about 500 miles west.  He preferred being considered a “newspaperman” rather than a “journalist” or “author.”</p>

<p>One remarkable period for Maupin was 1901-1913. Advocating for labor, Populism and the Democratic ticket, he was editor of a column for William Jennings Bryan’s <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/46032385/"><i>The Commoner</i></a> from 1901-1913, as well as the sole editor and publisher of the <i>Wageworker </i>, 1904-1911, and its succeeding title, <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/2017270207/"><i>Will Maupin’s Weekly</i></a>, 1911-1912. The <i>Commoner</i> had a national audience, while the latter two papers were largely addressed to Nebraskans. <i>Wageworker’s</i> motto was “a newspaper with a mission and without a muzzle” and as a Labor paper, defended the working man and woman, attacked monopolies such as Standard Oil, and decried imperialism. Some have described the paper as more “caustic” than the <i>Commoner</i>.  <i>Will Maupin’s Weekly</i> had a broader scope and although short-lived, met its goal of being “a snappy progressive weekly journal of news and comment.”</p>

<p>As a dedicated member of the International Typographical Union, Maupin had a strong commitment to labor, helping found the Nebraska Federation of Labor. According to Patricia Gaster’s article on Maupin in <i>Nebraska History</i>, Maupin was appointed deputy commissioner of the Nebraska Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics in 1909, and used his position to convene a delegate convention that pushed for a wage earners organization in the state. Delegates, including Maupin, drafted a platform that included “an eight-hour work day, enforcement of child labor laws, and equal pay for equal work by men and women.” This position gave him a taste for public life and fueled his newspaper writing. Although he was on state ballots for governor and representative, he won only one public election, serving as a State Railway Commissioner from 1935-1941. This provided some financial stability for his family, for money was always a concern. A practical idealist, Maupin worked hard on issues relating to wage earners when he could afford to do so, which is to say intermittently.</p>

<p>Often Maupin’s columns were leavened with humor, anecdotes and “poetic jabs” at personages such as Edward Rosewater, editor and owner of the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99021999/"><i>Omaha Daily Bee</i></a>.  Among popular columns, “Limnings,” and “Brain Leaks,” appeared in the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045765/"><i>Omaha Morning World Herald</i></a>. During Omaha’s world fair, the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition (1898), the column appeared briefly as “Snap Shots at the Passing Throng." Similar Maupin columns were “Whether Common or Not” in the <i>Commoner</i> and “Sunny Side Up” in the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95073287/"><i>Omaha Evening Bee-News</i></a> (begun years after Rosewater’s death). Columns were sometimes syndicated or collected into book form to help support his family.</p>

<p>By Maupin’s death in 1948, he had edited or written for around 40 newspapers.</p>
