<h4>The Plattsmouth Herald</h4>

<p>At the close of the Civil War, Hiram D. Hathaway and George L. Seybolt began publishing the pro-Republican <em>Nebraska Herald</em> in Plattsmouth, Nebraska, in 1865. The paper’s first extant copy Volume 1, Number 2, issued just 10 days after the fall of the Confederacy, reports in length about Secretary of State William Henry Seward’s reaction to the fall of Richmond. The following year, the paper issued a harsh denouncement of President Andrew Johnson’s veto of the Freedman’s Bureau Act.</p>

<p>Also in 1866, the <em>Herald</em> published its account of an incident that changed Nebraska’s history. Nebraska, still a territory, held a crucial vote in 1866. Politically, the voters of Nebraska were almost equally divided between Republican and Democrat. The vote hinged on a controversy in neighboring Rock Bluff, Nebraska wherein a ballot box had been taken home over a lunch break and the ballots subsequently thrown out, tilting the election toward the Republicans and thus statehood. The <em>Herald’s</em> July 18, 1866 story entitled “Rock Bluffs ‘Infamy’” reported on the controversy through a Republican lens. In a follow-up story the next week, they wrote, “Be not deceived by the men who howl about Rock Bluffs not being counted, it is all done to cover up their own dastardly performances, and to divert attention from the fact that the Democratic party of Nebraska stands pledged to the support of illegal voting and ballot-box stuffing.”</p>

<p>The <em>Herald</em> was often quoted in other Republican newspapers of the day, notably the <em>Red Cloud Chief</em> and future Nebraska Governor Robert Furnas’s <em>Nebraska Advertiser</em>, published in Brownville, Nebraska. In addition to promoting Plattsmouth, the <em>Herald</em> often promoted those communities as well. “We hope our neighbors at Brownville will succeed in getting their road at an early day.  It is a real nice thing to have a railroad, as Plattsmouth people can attest,” wrote the <em>Herald</em>.</p>

<p>In 1872, Hathaway left to join Charles Gere at the <em>State Journal</em> in Lincoln, and the paper passed to John Alexander MacMurphy. In 1870 and 1871, MacMurphy had written a series of letters to the <em>Omaha Republican</em> during Governor David Butler's impeachment trial under the pseudonym "Tip-Top". MacMurphy was influential in state politics and involved in the founding of the State Press Association, serving as secretary in 1873 and president in 1878. Harriet Sherrill Dakin MacMurphy worked alongside her husband.  Before marrying John, Harriet taught the Furnas children. With a newspaper career spanning more than 50 years, she became known as the "Dean of Nebraska Newspaperwomen."</p>

<p>Throughout the 1870s and 80s, the now-named <em>Plattsmouth Herald</em> bought out many competitors, including the German-language <em>Deutsche Wacht</em>; the <em>Plattsmouth Courant</em>, a short-lived Democratic paper; and <em>The Enterprise</em>, a Prohibition-Republican paper. Another competitor, <em>The Saturday Mirror</em> reported on May 2, 1891 about a previous incident between the <em>Herald</em> and Plattsmouth’s upstart Democratic paper, <em>The Plattsmouth Journal</em>. “The Herald publishing company were making strenuous efforts to choke out The Journal, which attempt ended rather disastrously for themselves the company losing fourteen thousand dollars, besides considerable personal funds of the stockholders.”</p>

<p>By the December 17, 1908 issue, the paper, now titled <em>Semi-Weekly News-Herald</em> was in bankruptcy, with Judge J. E. Douglass appointed trustee and charged with disposing of the paper’s assets. Douglass found a buyer and the paper continued publishing, but soon after the election of Woodrow Wilson in 1912, which saw the Republican party split between incumbent President William Howard Taft and former President Theodore Roosevelt, the <em>Herald</em> went out of business for good, folding to its rival <em>Journal</em>. The <em>Journal</em> celebrated the victory, calling the <em>Herald</em> “arrogant and condescending” and questioning the <em>Herald’s</em> previous financial dealings. The <em>Louisville Courier</em> observed, “the old hull went down like a rotten potato in a bucket of swill.”</p>
