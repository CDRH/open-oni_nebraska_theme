<h4>Nebraska Staats-Zeitung</h4>
<p>Launched on April 4, 1861, the <em>Nebraska Deutsche Zeitung</em> [No LCCN] was the first German-language newspaper in Nebraska, serving to attract European immigrants and support Unionism and Republicanism during the Civil War. Upon Nebraska becoming a state in 1867, the newspaper dropped the word “Deutsche” and added the word “Staats” to become the <em>Nebraska Staats-Zeitung</em>. The paper was published weekly on Fridays. The <em>Staats-Zeitung</em> was politically aligned with the Republican party until 1890, when it broke with the party, coming out in favor of tariffs supported by the Democratic party and against prohibition.</p>
<p>According to the May 3, 1908, <em>Omaha Bee</em> [LCCN: sn99021999], the <em>Staats-Zeitung</em> was started by 20 German Americans living in Nebraska City, subscribing for 100 shares of stock at $5 each. Frederick Renner, an immigrant from Spires, Germany was named secretary, editor, and business manager. Renner was also a practicing physician and army captain in the Otoe County Mounted Reserves. Renner was described as a “pioneer Republican and sturdy abolitionist” and “an earnest and scholarly editor”. The <em>Staats-Zeitung</em>, under Renner’s leadership, was credited with “bringing scores of thrifty Germans to southeastern Nebraska and Otoe County.” He was a Nebraska City councilman, elected to the territorial legislature in 1864, and was a member of the Nebraska constitutional convention. Renner continued to be associated with the paper in some form until moving to Omaha in 1892.</p>
<p>In November 1868, John A. Henzel became part owner of the paper, with Renner still serving as editor. In 1871, W.A. Brown and Sons of the <em>Daily Nebraska Press</em> [LCCN: sn95069538] assumed control of the publication. Renner then relocated part of the newspaper office to Lincoln but returned to Nebraska City full time in 1873. Subsequently, Jacob Beutler and Charles Young acquired the paper. After being appointed by Nebraska Senator Charles Van Wyck to the government printing office in Washington, D.C., Young sold his share to Adam Schaefer and Paul Schminke. Schminke, an immigrant from Hesse-Cassel, Germany was an adviser to Van Wyck, Nebraska City’s postmaster, mayor, and a state senator, where he famously argued against woman’s suffrage with Sen. Leonard Colby. With his brother Christian, Beutler continued running the paper until his death in 1906. An immigrant from Sembach, Germany, Jacob Beutler had learned the newspaper trade at the <em>Daily Nebraska Press</em>. </p>
<p>In 1912, when Val J. Peter, publisher of the <em>Tagliche Omaha Tribune</em> [LCCN: sn83045652], began buying up German language papers across the county to build his newspaper empire, one of his first purchases was the subscriber list for the <em>Staats-Zeitung</em>. However, the title kept publishing under the editorship of L. H. Rohmeyer, publisher of Auburn, Nebraska’s <em>Westlicher Beobachter</em> [No LCCN]. In a 1914 editorial, Rohmeyer wrote, “As German-American citizens, we declare our fealty and loyalty to our adopted country under any conditions that may arise in the future growing out of this conflict.” Despite Rohmeyer’s stance, like many German-language papers during World War I, the <em>Staats-Zeitung</em> ceased publication for good in 1915.</p>
