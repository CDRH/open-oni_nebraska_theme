<h4>The Plattsmouth Journal</h4>

<p>On Saturday November 5, 1881, Civil War veteran Charles “Cy” Sherman published the first issue of the <em>Plattsmouth Daily Journal</em>.  Sherman came across the Missouri River from Glenwood, Iowa, where he had founded and edited the <em>Mills County Times</em>.  In Plattsmouth, a spirited rivalry quickly developed between Sherman’s Democratic <em>Journal</em> and the Republican <em>Plattsmouth Herald</em>.  The battle raged for more than thirty years, until the <em>Journal</em> assumed control of the <em>Herald</em> in 1912.</p>

<p>Sherman's son, also named Cy, worked at the <em>Plattsmouth Journal</em> before becoming a long-time sports reporter in Lincoln, where he famously coined the moniker “Cornhuskers” for the Nebraska football team. Later, he would suggest to the Associated Press that it begin a nationwide poll of sports editors, leading to the AP Top 25 College Football Poll.</p>

<p>After the elder Sherman’s departure from Plattsmouth, the paper changed hands many times between 1896 and 1902. Its publishers during this period included Bart Kirkham and Frank Green, Harry Groves and William Dunroy, Germain Towl, and William K. Fox and George B. Mann.</p>

<p>In early 1902, brothers Robert and Thomas Bates purchased the paper.  They were assisted by their father Milford, a veteran newspaper publisher in Missouri.  When they took over the <em>Journal</em>, type was being set by hand.  By mid-1905, Robert had become sole owner and began modernizing the printing plant, moving to the Waterman Building on the southwest corner of Fourth and Main Streets in Plattsmouth, where it remained for nearly 50 years.</p>

<p>In July 1909, Robert married <em>Plattsmouth Journal</em> bookkeeper, Martha Rupley.  Together they published the <em>Journal</em> until Robert’s death in 1934, when Martha assumed publication of the paper and ran it successfully for the next ten years alongside her bookstore, Bates Book and Gift Shop. In 1937, with war clouds gathering, she began subscribing to international wire services.  Readership increased as the paper brought news of local boys on far-flung fronts.  After running the paper for 35 years and with increasing newspaper production costs due to the war, in November 1944, Martha sold the <em>Journal</em> to Lester A. Walker who then sold it to Ronald Furse in 1947.</p>

<p>Furse relocated the <em>Journal</em> offices to the North side of Main Street, where they remained for more than 50 years. Furse sold the paper to Howard Linquist and Eugene Scarlett in August 1957. J. W. and William Parsons bought the paper in 1973 and 10 years later sold the paper to George Miller of Papillion.  Under Miller the <em>Plattsmouth Journal</em> became part of the Lincoln Journal Star Printing Company.  In April 1996, Lee Enterprises, a media conglomerate based in Davenport, Iowa, acquired the printing company and along with it the <em>Plattsmouth Journal</em>.</p>

<p>Through the years the <em>Plattsmouth Journal</em> changed editors and publishers frequently and published as a daily, as a weekly, and as a semi-weekly, surviving fires, printing press problems, two world wars, and all competitors before ceasing publication in 2023.</p>
