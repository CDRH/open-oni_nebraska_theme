<h4>The Columbus Journal</h4>

<p>The <em>Columbus Journal</em>, published from 1874 to 1911, was the chief daily newspaper for Platte County and was also distributed in the northeast Nebraska counties of Merrick, Polk, Butler, Dodge, and Colfax.  The <em>Columbus Journal</em> succeeded the <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95073076/"><em>Platte Journal</em></a> (1870-74) and in 1911 merged with the <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95073080/"><em>Columbus Tribune</em></a>  to form the <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95073078/"><em>Columbus Tribune-Journal</em></a>.  In 1913, the title reverted to the <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95073079/"><em>Columbus Journal</em></a>.  During its long history, the <em>Journal</em> absorbed a number of newspapers, including the <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95073191/"><em>Columbus Times</em></a> in 1904 and the <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95073192/"><em>Platte County Argus</em></a> in 1906.  The <em>Journal</em> featured a broad eight-column format.</p>

<p>The paper's founder and chief editor from 1870 until his death in 1902 was Moses Kennedy (M.K.) Turner, a Civil War veteran who had served in Co. K, 170<sup>th</sup> Ohio. While editing the <em>Columbus Journal</em>, Turner also practiced law and remained active in politics, serving in the state legislature from 1880 to1881 and running unsuccessfully for the United States Congress in 1884 on a ticket endorsed by the independent Greenback and Anti-Monopoly parties.  In the salutatory statements in the first issue of the <em>Journal</em>, Turner wrote:  "We have two objects before us as publishers: First to conduct a good, independent local newspaper; second to make money thereby".  Although Turner stressed his independence from partisan ties, later contemporary accounts asserted that the<em> Columbus Journal </em>was an influential Republican force in the politics of Nebraska during the Gilded Age.</p>

<p>Turner's obituary noted that "There are few lines in professional life that admit of a chance of personal vengeance as does the newspaper, yet he never allowed this to interfere with what he considered his duty."  Following M.K.'s death, his daughter, Martha Margaret Turner--a full-time reporter for the <em>Journal </em>since 1887--served as editor for two years, at which time the paper was sold to a succession of owner/publishers. She later wrote for the important <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95069679/"><em>Nebraska State Journal</em></a>  and headed the newspaper department and founded the photography department at the Nebraska State Historical Society.</p>
