<h4>Stjernan</h4>
<p><em>Stjernan</em> or the “<em>Star</em>” was a weekly Danish-American paper published from 1885-1896—briefly in St. Paul, Nebraska, and soon thereafter in nearby Dannebrog, Nebraska. The annual subscription was $1.50. 
At its height, there were 2,600 subscribers, 600 from Dannebrog and 2,000 from other locales. From 1886-1896, the publisher and editor was Peter Ebbesen, who had emigrated from Denmark to the U.S. as a 
child. In a pioneer history of his life, he wrote that when he began as an editor, he could barely read or write Danish at all. In time, he noted that he gradually gained enough Danish to “pass” among the 
Danish community of Dannebrog. Despite this self-deprecating assessment, the paper itself is described in a 2003 article by author Karsten Kjer Christensen as remarkably well-organized, with interesting articles. 
The  newspaper’s letterpress lead type appears to have been taken from a mix of Scandinavian languages, although predominantly Danish fraktur.</p> 
<p>Christensen wrote that the first issue stated, “Readers and friends. Today we add a paper to the journalistic accumulation among Scandinavians in America. 
A beacon that with the cooperation of our compatriots we hope will be worthy of its name." After a few issues with church-related columns that were fraught with 
narrow doctrinal arguments, the paper carefully refrained from focusing on theological issues. Instead, it reported heavily on farming issues and commodities prices. 
At one point, Ebbesen encouraged farmers to submit their own stories about farming; however, this did not prove popular and the column was dropped. The paper also featured 
political news from both the U.S. and Denmark. Social news included reports of weddings, births and travel, primarily travel to Denmark. As Christensen noted, <em>Stjernan</em> 
readers saw themselves as “Danes in America” rather than Danish-Americans.</p>
<p>During a serious drought in 1896, a fire destroyed the newspaper office and the paper never recovered. Ebbesen moved back to St. Paul, Nebraska, and ran unsuccessfully 
for political office. Thereafter, he published and edited English-language newspapers in St. Paul.</p>
