<h4>Tägliche Omaha Tribüne</h4>

<p>The <i>Tägliche Omaha Tribüne </i>(1912-26), or the “Daily Omaha Tribune,” was founded by newspaper-entrepreneur Valentin (Val) Joseph Peter (1875-1960). According to various sources, it was “one of the most widely-circulated and influential German dailies in the country.” Aside from its pronounced pro-German stance, particularly before the United States entered World War I, the <i>Tägliche Omaha Tribüne </i>was largely independent. </p>

<p>When Val Peter was 14 years old, his family left Germany and moved to Rock Island, Illinois, where he soon worked as a reporter for the semiweekly <ahref="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92053952/"><i>Volkszeitung </i></ahref>, or “Peoples’ Newspaper.” Within three years, Peter was the city editor of a daily German-language newspaper, the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92054483/"><i>Peoria Sonne</i></a>, or the “Peoria Sun.” Thanks to a loan from the <i>Sonne</i>’s publishers, Peter returned to Rock Island to purchase the <i>Volkszeitung,</i> which he continued to edit until its sale in 1909.</p>

<p>In 1907, Peter purchased two Omaha newspapers—the <i>Westliche Presse</i> or “Western Press,” and the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95070031/"><i>Nebraska Tribüne</i></a>; the two soon merged to form the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95070032/"><i>Nebraska Tribüne und Westliche Presse</i></a> (1907-09). After moving permanently to Omaha in 1909, Peter published several succeeding titles—the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95070033/"><i>Omaha Tribüne</i></a> in 1909-12, and later the <i>Tägliche Omaha Tribüne</i>.</p>

<p>Peter became an outspoken member of the Nebraska chapter of the National German-American Alliance and served as its first and only president. During World War I, nativists deeply resented the passionate pro-German position of his editorials. The <i>Tribüne</i>’s newsboys were attacked, advertisers decamped, and Peter and his family were threatened with bodily harm. After America entered the war, Peter moderated his support for the German cause. Later, during World War II, all of his papers were staunchly supportive of the United States.</p>

<p>In spite of high anti-German sentiment in Omaha during the First World War, Peter was able to raise the circulation of the <i>Tribüne</i> by absorbing many smaller newspapers in Nebraska and Iowa. Among them (with the dates of acquisition, if known) were the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn94056356/"><i>Nebraska Volksblatt</i></a> (West Point, Nebraska), 1917; the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95070204/"><i>Platte River Zeitung</i></a> (Fremont, Nebraska), 1917; <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95070206/"><i>Die Nebraska Post</i></a> (Beatrice, Nebraska), 1918; the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95070207/"><i>Nebraska Biene</i></a> or “Nebraska Bee” (Columbus, Nebraska),  1918; the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95070208/"><i>Nebraska Echo</i></a> (Lincoln, Nebraska), 1918; the <i>Westlicher Beobachter</i> or “Western Watcher” (Auburn, Nebraska); the <i>Iowa Biene</i> or “Iowa Bee,” (Fort Dodge, Iowa); and the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84038136/"><i>Iowa Staats-Anzeiger</i></a> or “Iowa State Advertiser” (Des Moines, Iowa), 1914.  Thanks in part to these mergers, circulation of the <i>Tägliche Omaha Tribüne </i>grew from 17,500 in 1917 to 22,610 in 1920.</p>

<p>According to <i>Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics and History</i> (2005), Val Peter gradually built “the last major chain of German-language newspapers in America” by purchasing papers in California, Colorado, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, and Ohio. Many of these had been failing, so with the sole exception of a Baltimore newspaper edited by Peter’s sons, all were printed in Omaha.  Because of these purchases, consolidations, and Peter’s keen business acumen, James Bergquist observed in the <i>Yearbook of German-American Studies</i> (2005), “the chain developed into the dominant German-language voice in the West and after that began to expand into a national enterprise.”  Bergquist went on to note that “the Peter newspaper chain as a whole was greater than the largest single German-American newspaper of the day, the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045726/"><i>New Yorker Staats-Zeitung und Herold</i></a>, which as separate papers published about 70,000 copies daily in 1934 and as a combined…paper published about 50,000 in 1940.”</p>
