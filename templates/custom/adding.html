    <h3>Adding Newspapers</h3>

    <p>If you have funding and would like to see your newspapers added to Nebraska Newspapers, please see the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/">technical guidelines</a> provided on the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/">Chronicling America</a> website. All newspapers included here must follow the guidelines.</p>

    <p>Important considerations include the historical significance and the language(s) used in the newspaper. Other considerations include the availability, the technical quality, and the completeness of the microfilm. All newspapers must have a catalog record included in the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/titles/">US Newspaper Directory</a>.</p>

    <p>Before digitizing your newspapers for inclusion on the Nebraska Newspapers website, please consult with CDRH staff. They can be reached at <a href="mailto:cdrh@unl.edu">cdrh@unl.edu</a> or (402) 472-4547.</p>
