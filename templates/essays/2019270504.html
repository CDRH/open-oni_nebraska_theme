<h4>Weekly review</h4>
<p>The <em>Weekly Review</em> was a short-lived, but important African-American community newspaper published and edited by Reverend Trago T. McWilliams. McWilliams owned three restaurants in Lincoln called the Quality Diners. As a minister, he preached at African Methodist Episcopal churches, ending his career at Christ Temple Mission Church, one of Lincoln’s oldest multi-racial churches. Among the associate editors of the <em>Weekly Review</em> were Jennie Edwards, Millard Woods, and Loretta Swanegan. The annual subscription price for the 4-page newspaper was 50 cents.</p> 
<p>Published for several months early in 1933, the <em>Weekly Review</em> was a strong proponent of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and advocated for the formation of the Lincoln Urban League, a multi-racial organization that worked towards economic and social betterment of African-Americans and increased understanding among all races. Visiting dignitaries such as J. Harvey Kerns, Executive Secretary of the Omaha Urban League, and W. Robert Smalls, Executive Secretary of the Kansas City Urban League, supported the Lincoln Urban League organizing committee. The paper also reported on fundraising benefits for the Lincoln Urban League. One of the associate editors of the <em>Weekly Review</em> Millard Woods became the first director of the Lincoln Urban League. In 1955, the Lincoln Urban League was reorganized and became what is now known as the Clyde Malone Community Center, maintaining the mission of the Lincoln Urban League.</p> 
<p>The <em>Weekly Review</em> closely covered news of the Nebraska Legislature and its committees. In 1933, the Legislature still had a two-houses; it became a one-house unicameral in 1937. Also in early 1933, the Nation was still in the grips of the Great Depression, and its effects were deeply felt by African- Americans. Nebraska’s depressed conditions actually continued for months after the Great Depression was declared “over” in March 1933, hence the Legislature’s appropriations committee called for tax-reform and for the related need to reduce salaries of state employees. These issues repeatedly made the headlines in 1933. Municipal and city council election news included editorial comments about African-American interests in the elections, such as eliminating election bribery; alleviating “red lining” practices that made it difficult for African-Americans to find housing; addressing unemployment; and how to provide food to the unemployed—often through the efforts of church women, Columns such as “Church Notes,” “About Women” and “A Social Chat with Loretta” rounded out the paper.</p>
