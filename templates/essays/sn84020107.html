<h4>The Beatrice Daily Express</h4>
<p>Published six days a week over the course of forty years, the <em>Beatrice Daily Express</em> was an intimate and detailed portrait of an eastern Nebraska town as it boomed, faltered, and bounced back. Sunday was the lone day of the week when the <em>Express</em> fell silent. For the first half of its run, the <em>Beatrice Daily Express</em> was typically a simple four-page daily before expanding to a six-page paper. The cost of an annual subscription via mail reliably sat at $3.00. The <em>Beatrice Daily Express</em> provided an invaluable window into the news items that mattered most every day on the local, national, and international levels.</p>
<p>The <em>Beatrice Daily Express</em>, founded in 1884, grew out of a similarly named paper from the 1870s, the <em>Beatrice Express</em> [LCCN: sn84022806]. M.A. Brown was the initial leader of the <em>Daily Express</em> before a long succession of editors over the next four decades. Parallel to the <em>Daily Express</em> was a revolving series of weekly versions of the paper, including the <em>Beatrice Weekly Express</em> [LCCN: sn99021997] and the <em>Semi-Weekly Express</em> [LCCN: sn94056475]. </p>
<p>The <em>Beatrice Daily Express</em> was a proud suffragette publication. The staff of the <em>Express</em> featured content specifically tailored to women in a regular Woman’s World column. For one week in 1905, the paper was run each day by a different woman, giving them complete editorial control over that day’s content. As the January 18, 1905 <em>Nebraska State Journal</em> [LCCN: sn84020258] quoted the <em>Express</em>’s announcement of the arrangement, “Not because we are tired…but because we defer to the ambitious, thinking women of our city, we have opened our editorial columns, and next week six well known and prominent ladies of Beatrice will edit the Express.” The <em>Express</em> regularly featured the activities of Clara B. Colby, noted suffragette, publisher of the <em>Woman's Tribune</em> [LCCN: sn85038008], and one-time resident of Beatrice.</p>
<p>Like much of the country, hard times found Beatrice in the mid-1890s. This was due partly to the Panic of 1893 but more so to crop failures and cratering prices throughout Nebraska. According to the census, Beatrice had nearly 14,000 residents in 1890, but by 1900 this number had nearly halved. The <em>Daily Express</em> became the cheerleader for the battered community, with a steady drumbeat of optimism, stating on January 12, 1894 that, “One year ago Beatrice with her agricultural, manufacturing and railroad resources, was a flourishing, prosperous city, and this she would be today but for the senseless scare, and lack of confidence resulting from last summer’s panic, affecting all sections of the country alike. But this condition cannot long obtain, it is even now yielding to the resistless spirit and energy of the people.”</p>
<p>The paper reached its end in April 1924 when it was absorbed by the <em>Beatrice Daily Sun</em> [LCCN: sn86063415]. By June of that year the <em>Lincoln Star</em> [LCCN: sn91003329] wrote about “the machinery and equipment of the old Beatrice Daily Express” being sold by the <em>Sun</em>’s editor, closing the era of the <em>Daily Express</em>.</p>
