<h4>The Gordon Journal</h4>
<p>Once characterized by South Dakota’s <em>Hot Springs Weekly Star</em> [LCCN: sn96090259] in its June 15, 1900 issue as “a very readable and spicy paper,” the weekly <em>Gordon Journal</em> has enjoyed a long and distinguished run as one of the most prominent newspapers in northwest Nebraska. First published in 1891, the <em>Journal</em> originally cost $1.50 for a year’s subscription and was published every Friday.</p>
<p>H.G. Lyon was the paper’s founder and editor for its first decade, during which time it survived a burglary-attempt-turned-fire that nearly destroyed the <em>Journal</em>’s facilities. From 1903 to 1914, there was steady turnover in the paper’s leadership as one after another of its owners came and went. The period coinciding with World War I saw changes among ownership that visibly manifested on the pages of the <em>Journal</em>. A merger led to the single issue of the <em>Sheridan County Democrat and Gordon Journal</em> [LCCN: 2023271002] before reverting to the <em>Gordon Journal</em> title. For a few months in 1919, the newspaper switched to a twice-a-week format under the guise of the <em>Gordon Semi-Weekly Journal</em> [LCCN: 2023271004] before again reverting to the traditional format.</p>
<p>The war years also saw experiments in content. In March 1915, editors decided to cater to members of Gordon’s immigrant community and publish a news section in German, with the paper stating, “This week we give our German readers a little war news in their own tongue. This feature will be kept for a few weeks and if our friends appreciate it we will continue it as long as the war lasts.” The German section would remain in place until 1917, when rising anti-German sentiment had editors reconsidering this bilingual turn.  </p>
<p>Located south of the Pine Ridge Reservation, Gordon has had a long relationship with the native community, and in the newspaper, this prompted ample commentary, both positive and negative. The comings and goings of notables on the reservation were regularly written about as much as the social scuttlebutt in Gordon itself. Gordon’s business leaders repeatedly used the <em>Journal</em>’s pages to advocate for the establishment of better roads between the town and the reservation to facilitate closer economic ties. Hard  times also demonstrated the fickle nature of this neighborliness. Gordon was particularly hard hit by the 1918 influenza pandemic, with the October 24, 1918 issue reporting nearly 30 deaths since its last publication and a declaration of martial law. On that same page, an editorial blamed the severity of the pandemic on the unsanitary conditions of native camps in and around Gordon and called for their disbandment, saying, “We feel that we are speaking for the people of Gordon as a whole when we say that the Indian camps in the center of the city at least must be eliminated now and for all time.”</p>
<p>One of the political luminaries of post-WWI Nebraska dutifully sat at the editor’s desk of the <em>Gordon Journal</em>. Dwight Griswold acquired the paper from Boyd S. Leedom in 1922.  Previously a Nebraska State Representative at the time of his purchase, Griswold continued to run the paper as he served as state Senator from 1925 to 1929 as well as when he fruitlessly sought the governorship repeatedly throughout the 1930s. When at last he won election in 1940, Griswold relinquished his interest in the publication in favor of Joe Leedom, his long-time assistant, and son of former owner Boyd Leedom. Griswold served three terms as governor before becoming a US Senator in 1952. </p>
